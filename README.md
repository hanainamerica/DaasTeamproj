DAAS(Data Abstraction and Structures) is another course I took in community college, and I put a lot of efforts to do this final team project. 

Here is what I have learned from the project:

1. Do brainstorming before starting a project.
2. Write down every thoughts.
3. Use the programming language to make thoughts to reality.
4. Learn, do it, and ask questions. Repeat this.
